      "name": "Phosphatidylcholine (PC)",
      "description": "Phosphatidylcholine (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) is an amphiphilic molecule composed of a hydrophilic head group and hydrophobic tails, classified as a phospholipid with a choline moiety in its head group. It is extracted through mechanical processing or hexane extraction from natural sources such as egg yolk and soybeans. As one of the primary structural components of cell membranes, phosphatidylcholine (PC) is abundantly present in soybeans, egg yolks, animal livers, and fish. Being the most abundant phospholipid in the human body, it serves not only as a crucial maintainer of cell membrane structure and fluidity but also participates in lipid metabolism, neural signal transduction, and liver function regulation. It is acclaimed as both the \"architect of cell membranes\" and \"guardian of liver health.\"",

Recognized as \"nutrient for brain cell membranes\", it is widely used in cognitive health and anti-aging formulations.",
